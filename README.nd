The Romans were a clever bunch. They conquered most of
Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years. They invented concrete and straight roads and even bikinis⁶⁰. One thing they never discovered though was the number zero. This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today. For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date their programs.
For this Kata, write a function to convert from normal (Arabic) numbers to Roman Numerals:
1 -> I
10 -> X
7 -> VII
etc.

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didn’t tend to go any higher).
